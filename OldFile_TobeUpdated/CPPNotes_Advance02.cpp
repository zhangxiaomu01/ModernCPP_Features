//Section 16: Static Polymorphism
/*
By default, when we say polymorphism, we refer to dynamic polymorphism. However, 
dynamic polymorphism is sometimes costly for the following reasons:
1. Memory cost for virtual table (not significant);
2. Runtime cost for dynamic binding;
3. The main cost is in cache thrashing, i.e., the large and unpredictable jumps 
in execution causes frequent cache misses. In static poly., the calls are 
either exactly predictable (static) or inlined, which reduces cache misses 
significantly, often leading to an order of magnitude improvement in performance.

*/
/*
We will use the static polymorphism to simulate the dynamic polymorphism 
behavior. Then how can we implement static polymorphism? 
1. is-a relationship between base class and derived class;
2. Base class defines a "generic" algorithm that can be used in derived class;
3. The "generic" algorithm is customized by the derived class.

An example about the static polymorphism:
*/
struct TreeNode {
	int val;
	TreeNode* left;
	TreeNode* right;
};

/*
This is so called curiously recurring template pattern (static polymorphism, 
simulated polymorphism)
This is a small demo of TMP: template metaprogramming. The calculation of 
some part is raised in compiler time (in this example, dynamic binding!)
*/

//Section 17: Multiple Inheritance
/*
Only recommended to apply multiple inheritance for Interface segregation 
principle. Split large interface into smaller and more specific one so that the
client only need to know the interfaces that are of interest to them.

We can define derived class to derive from multiple pure abstract class:
An abstract class has one or more pure virtual funtion(s).

A pure abstract class contians only pure virtual functions, no data and no 
concrete functions.

Summary:
Derive only from pure abstract classes when using multiple inheritance 
techniques.

*- Impure virtual public function: inherit interface and defult implementation;
*- protected function: inherit implementation only

*As a SDE, it's important to separate the concepts of interface and implementation.

*
*Implementation inheritance is generally discouraged.
