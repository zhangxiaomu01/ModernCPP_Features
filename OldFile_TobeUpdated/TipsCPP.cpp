//12. Dijkstra Algorithm!
//https://www.hackerearth.com/zh/practice/algorithms/graphs/shortest-path-algorithms/tutorial/
/*
Dijkstra's algorithm has many variants but the most common one is to find the 
shortest paths from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

Algorithm Steps:

1. Set all vertices distances = infinity except for the source vertex, set the 
source distance = 0.
2. Push the source vertex in a min-priority queue in the form (distance , vertex)
, as the comparison in the min-priority queue will be according to vertices 
distances.
3. Pop the vertex with the minimum distance from the priority queue (at first 
the popped vertex = source).
4. Update the distances of the connected vertices to the popped vertex in case 
of "current vertex distance + edge weight < next vertex distance", then push 
the vertex with the new distance to the priority queue.
5. If the popped vertex is visited before, just continue without using it.
6. Apply the same algorithm again until the priority queue is empty.

Time Complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is O(|V|^2), but with min-priority queue
 it drops down to O(|V| + |E|log|V|).

The following implementation assumes the source node to be 1

Bellman Ford's Algorithm:
Bellman Ford's algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from the source 
vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It depends on the following 
concept: Shortest path contains at most n-1 edges, because the shortest path 
couldn't have a cycle.

So why shortest path shouldn't have a cycle ?
There is no need to pass a vertex again, because the shortest path to all other 
vertices could be found without the need for a second visit for any vertices.

Algorithm Steps:

1. The outer loop traverses from  0 - n-1.
2. Loop over all edges, check if the next node distance > current node distance + 
edge weight, in this case update the next node distance to "current node 
distance + edge weight".

This algorithm depends on the relaxation principle where the shortest distance 
for all vertices is gradually replaced by more accurate values until eventually 
reaching the optimum solution. In the beginning all vertices have a distance 
of "Infinity", but only the distance of the source vertex = 0, then update all 
the connected vertices with the new distances (source vertex distance + edge 
weights), then apply the same concept for the new vertices with new distances 
and so on.

A very important application of Bellman Ford is to check if there is a negative
cycle in the graph. When we finished the n-1 iteration, we can do one more
iteration and check whether our shortest path value can still decreasing. If we
find such path, then there must be a negative cycle!

Time Complexity of Bellman Ford algorithm is relatively high O(|V||E|), 
in case |E| = |V|^2 , O(|E|^3) .

//14. Floyd–Warshall's Algorithm
//https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwJdNfdLF9s
//https://www.hackerearth.com/zh/practice/algorithms/graphs/shortest-path-algorithms/tutorial/
/*
Floyd–Warshall's Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between between 
all pairs of vertices in a graph, where each edge in the graph has a weight 
which is positive or negative. The biggest advantage of using this algorithm 
is that all the shortest distances between any 2 vertices could be calculated 
in O(|V|^3), where V is the number of vertices in a graph.

The Algorithm Steps:

For a graph with N vertices:

1. Initialize the shortest paths between any 2 vertices with Infinity.
2. Find all pair shortest paths that use 0 intermediate vertices, then find the 
shortest paths that use 1 intermediate vertex and so on.. until using all N
vertices as intermediate nodes.
3. Minimize the shortest paths between any 2 pairs in the previous operation.
4. For any 2 vertices (i, j), one should actually minimize the distances between
this pair using the first K nodes, so the shortest path will be: 
min(dist[i][K] + dist[K][j], dist[i][j]).
dist[i][K] represents the shortest path that only uses the first K vertices,
dist[K][j] represents the shortest path between the pair k, j. As the shortest 
path will be a concatenation of the shortest path from i to K, then from K to j.

Time Complexity of Floyd–Warshall's Algorithm is O(|V|^3).

//15. Binary Indexed Tree
//https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree-2/
/*
Representation
Binary Indexed Tree is represented as an array. Let the array be BITree[]. 
Each node of the Binary Indexed Tree stores the sum of some elements of the 
input array. The size of the Binary Indexed Tree is equal to the size of the 
input array, denoted as n. In the code below, we use a size of n+1 for ease of 
implementation.

Construction
We initialize all the values in BITree[] as 0. Then we call update() for all 
the indexes, the update() operation is discussed below.

Operations:
getSum(x): Returns the sum of the sub-array arr[0,...,x]
// Returns the sum of the sub-array arr[0,...,x] using BITree[0..n], which is 
constructed from arr[0..n-1]
1) Initialize the output sum as 0, the current index as x+1.
2) Do following while the current index is greater than 0.
...a) Add BITree[index] to sum
...b) Go to the parent of BITree[index].  The parent can be obtained by removing
     the last set bit from the current index, i.e., 
     index = index - (index & (-index))
3) Return sum.

BITree[0] is a dummy node.

BITree[y] is the parent of BITree[x], if and only if y can be obtained by 
removing the last set bit from the binary representation of x, that is 
y = x – (x & (-x)).

The child node BITree[x] of the node BITree[y] stores the sum of the elements 
between y(inclusive) and x(exclusive): arr[y,…,x).

update(x, val): Updates the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) by performing 
arr[index] += val
// Note that the update(x, val) operation will not change arr[]. It only makes 
changes to BITree[]
1) Initialize the current index as x+1.
2) Do the following while the current index is smaller than or equal to n.
...a) Add the val to BITree[index]
...b) Go to parent of BITree[index].  The parent can be obtained by incrementing
     the last set bit of the current index, i.e., 
     index = index + (index & (-index))

The update function needs to make sure that all the BITree nodes which contain 
arr[i] within their ranges being updated. We loop over such nodes in the BITree
 by repeatedly adding the decimal number corresponding to the last set bit of 
 the current index.

 How does Binary Indexed Tree work?
The idea is based on the fact that all positive integers can be represented as 
the sum of powers of 2. For example 19 can be represented as 16 + 2 + 1. Every 
node of the BITree stores the sum of n elements where n is a power of 2. 
For example, in the first diagram above (the diagram for getSum()), the sum of
the first 12 elements can be obtained by the sum of the last 4 elements (from 
9 to 12) plus the sum of 8 elements (from 1 to 8). The number of set bits in 
the binary representation of a number n is O(Logn). Therefore, we traverse 
at-most O(Logn) nodes in both getSum() and update() operations. The time 
complexity of the construction is O(nLogn) as it calls update() for all n 
elements.

//16. AVL Tree (Insertion & Deletion)
/*
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference 
between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all 
nodes.

Insertion
To make sure that the given tree remains AVL after every insertion, we must 
augment the standard BST insert operation to perform some re-balancing. 
Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST 
without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) < keys(right)).
1) Left Rotation
2) Right Rotation

Steps to follow for insertion
Let the newly inserted node be w
1) Perform standard BST insert for w.
2) Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the 
first unbalanced node, y be the child of z that comes on the path from w to z 
and x be the grandchild of z that comes on the path from w to z.
3) Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree 
rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y 
and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:
    a) y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
    b) y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
    c) y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
    d) y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

Following are the operations to be performed in above mentioned 4 cases. In all 
of the cases, we only need to re-balance the subtree rooted with z and the 
complete tree becomes balanced as the height of subtree (After appropriate 
rotations) rooted with z becomes same as it was before insertion. 

a) Left Left Case
T1, T2, T3 and T4 are subtrees.
         z                                      y 
        / \                                   /   \
       y   T4      Right Rotate (z)          x      z
      / \          - - - - - - - - ->      /  \    /  \ 
     x   T3                               T1  T2  T3  T4
    / \
  T1   T2

b) Left Right Case
     z                               z                           x
    / \                            /   \                        /  \ 
   y   T4  Left Rotate (y)        x    T4  Right Rotate(z)    y      z
  / \      - - - - - - - - ->    /  \      - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
T1   x                          y    T3                    T1  T2 T3  T4
    / \                        / \
  T2   T3                    T1   T2

c) Right Right Case
  z                                y
 /  \                            /   \ 
T1   y     Left Rotate(z)       z      x
    /  \   - - - - - - - ->    / \    / \
   T2   x                     T1  T2 T3  T4
       / \
     T3  T4

d) Right Left Case
   z                            z                            x
  / \                          / \                          /  \ 
T1   y   Right Rotate (y)    T1   x      Left Rotate(z)   z      y
    / \  - - - - - - - - ->     /  \   - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
   x   T4                      T2   y                  T1  T2  T3  T4
  / \                              /  \
T2   T3                           T3   T4

Implementation
Following is the implementation for AVL Tree Insertion. The following 
implementation uses the recursive BST insert to insert a new node. In the 
recursive BST insert, after insertion, we get pointers to all ancestors one 
by one in a bottom-up manner. So we don’t need parent pointer to travel up. 
The recursive code itself travels up and visits all the ancestors of the newly 
inserted node.
1) Perform the normal BST insertion.
2) The current node must be one of the ancestors of the newly inserted node. 
Update the height of the current node.
3) Get the balance factor (left subtree height – right subtree height) of the 
current node.
4) If balance factor is greater than 1, then the current node is unbalanced and 
we are either in Left Left case or left Right case. To check whether it is left 
left case or not, compare the newly inserted key with the key in left subtree 
root.
5) If balance factor is less than -1, then the current node is unbalanced and 
we are either in Right Right case or Right-Left case. To check whether it is 
Right Right case or not, compare the newly inserted key with the key in right 
subtree root.

Steps to follow for deletion.
To make sure that the given tree remains AVL after every deletion, we must 
augment the standard BST delete operation to perform some re-balancing. 
Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST 
without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) < keys(right)).
1) Left Rotation
2) Right Rotation

Let w be the node to be deleted
1) Perform standard BST delete for w.
2) Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the 
first unbalanced node, y be the larger height child of z, and x be the larger 
height child of y. Note that the definitions of x and y are different from 
insertion here.
3) Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree 
rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y 
and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:
    a) y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
    b) y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
    c) y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
    d) y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

Like insertion, following are the operations to be performed in above 
mentioned 4 cases. Note that, unlike insertion, fixing the node z won’t fix 
the complete AVL tree. After fixing z, we may have to fix ancestors of z as 
well.

a) Left Left Case
T1, T2, T3 and T4 are subtrees.
         z                                      y 
        / \                                   /   \
       y   T4      Right Rotate (z)          x      z
      / \          - - - - - - - - ->      /  \    /  \ 
     x   T3                               T1  T2  T3  T4
    / \
  T1   T2

b) Left Right Case
     z                               z                           x
    / \                            /   \                        /  \ 
   y   T4  Left Rotate (y)        x    T4  Right Rotate(z)    y      z
  / \      - - - - - - - - ->    /  \      - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
T1   x                          y    T3                    T1  T2 T3  T4
    / \                        / \
  T2   T3                    T1   T2

c) Right Right Case
  z                                y
 /  \                            /   \ 
T1   y     Left Rotate(z)       z      x
    /  \   - - - - - - - ->    / \    / \
   T2   x                     T1  T2 T3  T4
       / \
     T3  T4

d) Right Left Case
   z                            z                            x
  / \                          / \                          /  \ 
T1   y   Right Rotate (y)    T1   x      Left Rotate(z)   z      y
    / \  - - - - - - - - ->     /  \   - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
   x   T4                      T2   y                  T1  T2  T3  T4
  / \                              /  \
T2   T3                           T3   T4

Unlike insertion, in deletion, after we perform a rotation at z, we may have 
to perform a rotation at ancestors of z. Thus, we must continue to trace the 
path until we reach the root.

C implementation
Following is the C implementation for AVL Tree Deletion. The following C 
implementation uses the recursive BST delete as basis. In the recursive BST 
delete, after deletion, we get pointers to all ancestors one by one in bottom 
up manner. So we don’t need parent pointer to travel up. The recursive code 
itself travels up and visits all the ancestors of the deleted node.
1) Perform the normal BST deletion.
2) The current node must be one of the ancestors of the deleted node. Update 
the height of the current node.
3) Get the balance factor (left subtree height – right subtree height) of the 
current node.
4) If balance factor is greater than 1, then the current node is unbalanced 
and we are either in Left Left case or Left Right case. To check whether it is 
Left Left case or Left Right case, get the balance factor of left subtree. 
If balance factor of the left subtree is greater than or equal to 0, then it 
is Left Left case, else Left Right case.
5) If balance factor is less than -1, then the current node is unbalanced and 
we are either in Right Right case or Right Left case. To check whether it is 
Right Right case or Right Left case, get the balance factor of right subtree. 
If the balance factor of the right subtree is smaller than or equal to 0, then 
it is Right Right case, else Right Left case.

// 17. Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)
/*
What is Minimum Spanning Tree?
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a 
subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph 
can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or 
minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph 
is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other 
spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to 
each edge of the spanning tree.

How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has?
A minimum spanning tree has (|V| – 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in 
the given graph.

Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal’s algorithm
1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree 
formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
The step#2 uses Union-Find algorithm to detect cycle.
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

Time Complexity: O(ElogE) or O(ElogV). Sorting of edges takes O(ELogE) time. 
After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply find-union algorithm. 
The find and union operations can take atmost O(LogV) time. So overall 
complexity is O(ELogE + ELogV) time. The value of E can be atmost O(V2), 
so O(LogV) are O(LogE) same. Therefore, overall time complexity is O(ElogE) 
or O(ElogV).

// 18. Binary Heap
/*
A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
1) It’s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the 
last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property 
of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

2) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key 
at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same 
property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary 
Heap is similar to MinHeap.

How is Binary Heap represented?
A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A binary heap is typically represented as an array.

The root element will be at Arr[0].
Below table shows indexes of other nodes for the ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:
Arr[(i-1)/2]	Returns the parent node
Arr[(2*i)+1]	Returns the left child node
Arr[(2*i)+2]	Returns the right child node
The traversal method use to achieve Array representation is Level Order.

Operations on Min Heap:
1) getMini(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this 
operation is O(1).

2) extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of 
this Operation is O(Logn) as this operation needs to maintain the heap 
property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.

3) decreaseKey(): Decreases value of key. The time complexity of this 
operation is O(Logn). If the decreases key value of a node is greater than 
the parent of the node, then we don’t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need 
to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.

4) insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Logn) time. We add a new key at the 
end of the tree. IF new key is greater than its parent, then we don’t need to 
do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap 
property.

5) delete(): Deleting a key also takes O(Logn) time. We replace the key to be 
deleted with minum infinite by calling decreaseKey(). After decreaseKey(), the 
minus infinite value must reach root, so we call extractMin() to remove the key.

// 19. Prim's MST algorithm
/*
Prim’s algorithm is also a Greedy algorithm. It starts with an empty spanning 
tree. The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. The first set contains the 
vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not 
yet included. At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two 
sets, and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges. After picking the 
edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST.

A group of edges that connects two set of vertices in a graph is called cut 
in graph theory. So, at every step of Prim’s algorithm, we find a cut (of two 
sets, one contains the vertices already included in MST and other contains 
rest of the verices), pick the minimum weight edge from the cut and include 
this vertex to MST Set (the set that contains already included vertices).

Algorithm
1) Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST.
2) Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key 
values as INFINITE. Assign key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is 
picked first.
3) While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices
….a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has minimum key value.
….b) Include u to mstSet.
….c) Update key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values,
iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if weight 
of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as 
weight of u-v。

The idea of using key values is to pick the minimum weight edge from cut. The 
key values are used only for vertices which are not yet included in MST, the 
key value for these vertices indicate the minimum weight edges connecting them
to the set of vertices included in MST.

How to implement the above algorithm?
We use a boolean array mstSet[] to represent the set of vertices included in 
MST. If a value mstSet[v] is true, then vertex v is included in MST, otherwise 
not. Array key[] is used to store key values of all vertices. Another array 
parent[] to store indexes of parent nodes in MST. The parent array is the 
output array which is used to show the constructed MST.

Time Complexity of the above program is O(V^2). If the input graph is 
represented using adjacency list, then the time complexity of Prim’s 
algorithm can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap.
