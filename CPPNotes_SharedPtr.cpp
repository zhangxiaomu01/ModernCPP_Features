    /* Lesson: An object should be assigned to a shrared_pointer immediately when it is created. The above case does not follow this rule. We first create the raw pointer d and then initialize p and p2 with d. We should do somthing like: shared_ptr<Dog> p(new Dog("Tank")), then shared_ptr<Dog> p2 = p.*/

    //Another way to create a shared pointer:
    shared_ptr<Dog> p = make_shared<Dog>("Thank"); //Faster and safer/ Exception safe
    (*p).bark();
    //The following function can also work on shared pointers
    // static_pointer_cast
    // dynamic_pointer_cast
    // const_pointer_cast
